## Security Measures

### Infrastructure & CI/CD Security

-   🔒 **Branch Protection**: The `main` branch is protected, requiring pull request reviews and passing status checks before merging.
-   🤖 **Automated Security Scanning**: We use CodeQL analysis on every pull request to find potential vulnerabilities.
-   📦 **Dependency Monitoring**: Dependabot performs weekly scans and creates pull requests for security updates to our dependencies.
-   🔍 **Vulnerability Scanning**: `npm audit` is integrated into our CI/CD pipeline to check for known vulnerabilities in our packages.
-   🐳 **Container Security**: We use tools like Trivy to scan our Docker images for vulnerabilities.

### Application Security

-   🔐 **Authentication**: Secure management of API keys and access tokens.
-   🌐 **CORS**: We configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing to restrict which domains can access our resources.
-   🛡️ **Security Headers**: We use Helmet.js to set various HTTP headers that help protect the app from common web vulnerabilities.
-   🔑 **Secrets Management**: All sensitive data, such as API keys and credentials, are managed as GitHub Actions secrets and are never committed to the repository.
-   📜 **Audit Logging**: We maintain comprehensive logs of important activities within the system.

### Deployment Security

-   🔒 **HTTPS Only**: We enforce SSL/TLS encryption for all network connections.
-   ☁️ **CDN Security**: We leverage the security features of the Alibaba Cloud CDN.
-   📊 **Monitoring**: We use real-time security monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to threats quickly.
-   🔄 **Automated Updates**: We have processes in place for the automated deployment of security patches.
-   🚫 **Access Control**: We enforce the principle of least privilege with role-based access controls.

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1.  **Code Review**: All code changes must be reviewed by at least one other developer.
2.  **Static Analysis**: We use ESLint with security-focused rules to catch common issues early.
3.  **Dependency Management**: Keep all dependencies up-to-date and regularly audit them.
4.  **Secret Handling**: Never commit secrets directly to the codebase. Use environment variables and secret management tools.
5.  **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user-provided input on both the client and server sides.

## Incident Response

### Response Team

-   **Security Lead**: @deedk822-lang
-   **Technical Lead**: Development Team
-   **Communications**: Community Management

### Response Process

1.  **Detection**: An issue is detected via automated monitoring or a manual report.
2.  **Assessment**: We analyze the severity and potential impact of the issue.
3.  **Containment**: We take immediate action to mitigate the threat.
4.  **Investigation**: We perform a root cause analysis to understand the vulnerability.
5.  **Resolution**: We develop and deploy a patch to fix the issue.
6.  **Recovery**: We restore and validate system functionality.
7.  **Post-Incident Review**: We conduct a lessons-learned session to improve our processes.
