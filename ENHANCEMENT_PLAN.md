## Usage Examples

### Basic Query Processing
```typescript
import { CognitiveOrchestrator } from './src/agents/CognitiveOrchestrator';
import { ReasoningEngine } from './src/agents/ReasoningEngine';

const orchestrator = new CognitiveOrchestrator();
const reasoningEngine = new ReasoningEngine(orchestrator);

// Complex reasoning with multiple perspectives
const result = await reasoningEngine.performAdvancedReasoning(
  "Analyze the implications of implementing AI governance in government operations",
  {
    domain: 'government_policy',
    complexity: 'complex',
    requires_analysis: true,
    requires_creativity: true
  }
);

console.log('Conclusion:', result.conclusion);
console.log('Confidence:', result.confidence);
console.log('Alternatives:', result.alternatives);
console.log('Evidence:', result.evidence);
```

### Cost-Optimized Processing
```typescript
// Router-first design automatically optimizes cost
const response = await orchestrator.processComplexQuery(
  "Simple factual question about GDP statistics",
  {
    complexity: 'simple',
    urgency: 'low'
  }
);
// Automatically routes to GLM-4.5 (cost: $0.03 vs GPT-5: $0.15)
```

### Cache-Enabled Processing
```typescript
// Semantic cache provides 41% cost reduction
const cachedResponse = await orchestrator.processComplexQuery(
  "What are the benefits of renewable energy?"
);
// Similar queries automatically retrieved from cache
```
