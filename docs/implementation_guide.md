# Implementation Guide for SovereigntyOS Multi-Agent Orchestration

This guide provides comprehensive instructions on setting up and utilizing the multi-agent orchestration system for the SovereigntyOS project. It covers the production build and hardening of a CronJob Docker image, deployment to Alibaba Cloud, and the integration of automated revenue generation mechanisms, all orchestrated via Agent TARS.

## 1. Agent TARS Configuration (`agent-tars.config.ts`)

The `agent-tars.config.ts` file defines the various AI agents, their respective model configurations, and their specific instructions. This TypeScript file provides type safety and code completion, making it the recommended approach for managing agent settings.

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from '@agent-tars/interface';

export default defineConfig({
  // Model configurations for each agent
  agents: {
    gpt5_orchestrator: {
      model: {
        provider: 'openai',
        id: 'gpt-5', // Placeholder for GPT-5
        apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY, // Assuming OpenAI API key for GPT-5
      },
      browser: {
        control: 'hybrid',
      },
      instructions: [
        'Decompose the overall task into sub-tasks: Docker image hardening, Alibaba Cloud deployment, and revenue generation.',
        'Coordinate the execution of Claude 4.5, Z.ai GLM-4.6, and Kimi K2.',
        'Oversee the Alibaba Cloud deployment strategy, including service selection and resource allocation.',
        'Orchestrate the integration of automated revenue generation mechanisms, defining billing logic and payment gateway interactions.',
        'Synthesize results from all agents and prepare final reports or pull requests.',
      ],
    },
    claude_coding_expert: {
      model: {
        provider: 'anthropic',
        id: 'claude-4.5', // Placeholder for Claude 4.5
        apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
      },
      browser: {
        control: 'hybrid',
      },
      instructions: [
        'Develop Dockerfiles for multi-stage builds, non-root user execution, and optimized layers for the CronJob image.',
        'Write code for `sovereigntyos_ai` functions, ensuring they are compatible with Alibaba Cloud SAE/FC.',
        'Implement in-function usage logging for revenue generation tracking.',
        'Develop functions for processing usage logs and interacting with payment gateway APIs (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).',
        'Implement access control logic based on user subscription status.',
      ],
    },
    zai_tool_caller: {
      model: {
        provider: 'google', // Placeholder provider for Z.ai GLM-4.6
        id: 'glm-4.6', // Placeholder for Z.ai GLM-4.6
        apiKey: process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY, // Assuming Google API key
      },
      browser: {
        control: 'hybrid',
      },
      instructions: [
        'Execute shell commands for building, testing, and pushing Docker images to Alibaba Cloud Container Registry (ACR).',
        'Interact with the GitHub repository using `gh` CLI for cloning, branching, committing, and creating pull requests.',
        'Execute Alibaba Cloud CLI commands for environment setup (e.g., `aliyun configure`, `aliyun cr CreateNamespace`).',
        'Execute Alibaba Cloud CLI commands for deploying and updating SAE applications and scheduled tasks.',
        'Configure Alibaba Cloud API Gateway to expose `sovereigntyos_ai` functions as monetized APIs.',
      ],
    },
    kimi_workflow_executor: {
      model: {
        provider: 'google', // Placeholder provider for Kimi K2
        id: 'kimi-k2', // Placeholder for Kimi K2
        apiKey: process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY, // Assuming Google API key
      },
      browser: {
        control: 'hybrid',
      },
      instructions: [
        'Automate complex, multi-step workflows for the entire CI/CD pipeline, from code commit to deployment.',
        'Monitor deployed functions and revenue streams for operational health and performance.',
        'Automate tasks related to subscription management, including activation, deactivation, and reminders.',
        'Ensure seamless orchestration of tasks between Claude 4.5 and Z.ai GLM-4.6 under GPT-5\'s guidance.',
      ],
    },
  },

  // Global browser control mode if not specified per agent
  browser: {
    control: 'hybrid',
  },

  // ... other global configurations if needed
});
```

**Key Points:**

*   **`agents` Object:** This top-level object defines individual agents by a unique key (e.g., `gpt5_orchestrator`).
*   **`model` Configuration:** Each agent specifies its `provider` (e.g., `openai`, `anthropic`, `google`), `id` (model name), and `apiKey`. API keys are typically loaded from environment variables for security.
*   **`browser` Control:** The `browser.control` setting dictates how the agent interacts with web browsers. `hybrid` is a common choice, combining visual grounding and DOM interaction.
*   **`instructions` Array:** A new `instructions` array has been added to each agent's configuration, detailing their specific responsibilities and commands within the overall orchestration.

## 2. Agent Interaction and Workflow

The orchestration process involves the coordinated effort of the defined agents, managed by GPT-5 as the Lead Orchestrator:

1.  **Initiation:** The process begins with a command to Agent TARS, such as `manus-ai start task [SovereigntyOS] Production Build & Hardening for CronJob Image, Alibaba Cloud Deployment, and Automated Revenue Generation`.
2.  **Task Decomposition (GPT-5):** GPT-5 breaks down the high-level goal into smaller, actionable sub-tasks, distributing them among the specialized agents.
3.  **Docker Image Hardening (Claude 4.5 & Z.ai GLM-4.6):**
    *   **Claude 4.5** generates the Dockerfile for multi-stage builds, non-root user execution, and optimized layers.
    *   **Z.ai GLM-4.6** executes `docker build` and `docker push` commands to build the image and push it to Alibaba Cloud Container Registry (ACR).
4.  **Alibaba Cloud Deployment (Z.ai GLM-4.6):**
    *   **Z.ai GLM-4.6** uses the Alibaba Cloud CLI (`aliyun`) to:
        *   Configure the Alibaba Cloud environment (e.g., `aliyun configure`).
        *   Create necessary resources like ACR namespaces.
        *   Deploy `sovereigntyos_ai` functions to Serverless App Engine (SAE) or Function Compute (FC).
        *   Create and update SAE Scheduled Tasks for the CronJob image.
        *   Configure Alibaba Cloud API Gateway to expose `sovereigntyos_ai` functions as APIs.
5.  **Automated Revenue Generation (Claude 4.5 & GPT-5 & Kimi K2):**
    *   **Claude 4.5** implements in-function usage logging and develops functions for processing logs and interacting with payment gateway APIs.
    *   **GPT-5** orchestrates the billing logic and integration with payment systems, defining subscription tiers.
    *   **Kimi K2** automates subscription management tasks and monitors revenue streams.
6.  **Autonomous Multi-Step Workflow Execution (Kimi K2):** Kimi K2 ensures the seamless execution of the entire CI/CD pipeline, from code commit to deployment and ongoing monitoring.
7.  **Result Synthesis (GPT-5):** GPT-5 collects outputs from all agents, synthesizes them, and prepares final reports or pull requests to the GitHub repository (`deedk822-lang/sovereigntyos_AI`).

## 3. Detailed Deployment Steps

Refer to the `alibaba_cloud_deployment_plan.md` document for detailed steps on preparing the Alibaba Cloud environment, building and pushing Docker images, and deploying to SAE, including specific CLI commands.

## 4. Automated Revenue Generation Integration

Refer to the `revenue_generation_summary.md` document for detailed strategies on API monetization, usage tracking, billing, and subscription management within the Alibaba Cloud environment.

## 5. Starting the Agent TARS Task

To initiate the entire process, the following command would be used:

```bash
agent-tars --config ./agent-tars.config.ts --start-command "@Manus manus-ai start task [SovereigntyOS] Production Build & Hardening for CronJob Image, Alibaba Cloud Deployment, and Automated Revenue Generation"
```

This command tells Agent TARS to use the specified configuration file and to start the task with the given title, which will then be decomposed and executed by the orchestrated agents according to their defined instructions.
