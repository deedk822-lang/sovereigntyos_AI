# Agent TARS Configuration and Deployment Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the Agent TARS multi-agent orchestration system for the SovereigntyOS AI project, including configuration, deployment to Alibaba Cloud, and automated revenue generation.

## Overview

The SovereigntyOS AI project leverages a multi-agent orchestration system powered by Agent TARS, where specialized AI agents collaborate to build, deploy, and monetize the application on Alibaba Cloud.

### Agent Architecture

| Agent | Role | Responsibilities |
|-------|------|------------------|
| **GPT-5** | Lead Orchestrator & Decomposer | Task decomposition, workflow coordination, deployment strategy oversight, revenue generation orchestration |
| **Claude 4.5** | Coding & Deep Reasoning Expert | Dockerfile development, application code, usage logging, payment gateway integration, access control |
| **Z.ai GLM-4.6** | Tool-Calling Powerhouse | Docker operations, GitHub CLI interactions, Alibaba Cloud CLI execution, API Gateway configuration |
| **Kimi K2** | Autonomous Multi-Step Workflow Executor | CI/CD pipeline automation, monitoring, subscription management |

## Configuration Files

### 1. Agent TARS Configuration (`agent-tars.config.ts`)

The main configuration file that defines each agent's model, provider, and specific instructions. Located in the repository root.

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from '@agent-tars/interface';

export default defineConfig({
  agents: {
    gpt5_orchestrator: { /* ... */ },
    claude_coding_expert: { /* ... */ },
    zai_tool_caller: { /* ... */ },
    kimi_workflow_executor: { /* ... */ }
  }
});
```

### 2. Deployment Scripts

*   **`scripts/deploy-alibaba-cloud.sh`**: ACK (Alibaba Container Service for Kubernetes) deployment
*   **`scripts/deploy-sae.sh`**: SAE (Serverless App Engine) deployment for CronJobs

### 3. Dockerfiles

*   **`Dockerfile`**: Main application Docker image (web frontend)
*   **`Dockerfile.cronjob`**: Production-hardened CronJob image with multi-stage build and non-root user

## Deployment to Alibaba Cloud

### Prerequisites

1.  **Alibaba Cloud Account**: Active account with appropriate permissions
2.  **Alibaba Cloud CLI**: Installed and configured (`aliyun configure`)
3.  **Docker**: Installed for building images
4.  **GitHub Secrets**: Configure the following in your repository:
    *   `ALIBABA_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
    *   `ALIBABA_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET`
    *   `ALIBABA_REGISTRY_USERNAME`
    *   `ALIBABA_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`
    *   `SAE_NAMESPACE_ID`
    *   `SAE_APP_NAME`

### Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Automated Deployment via GitHub Actions

Push to the `main` branch to trigger the automated deployment workflow:

```bash
git push origin main
```

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-alibaba-cloud.yml`) will:
1.  Run tests and build the application
2.  Build and push the Docker image to ACR
3.  Deploy to Alibaba Cloud SAE

#### Option 2: Manual Deployment

**For SAE (Serverless App Engine):**

```bash
export SAE_NAMESPACE_ID="your-namespace-id"
export SAE_APP_NAME="sovereigntyos-ai-cronjob"
export ALIBABA_REGION="cn-hangzhou"

./scripts/deploy-sae.sh
```

**For ACK (Kubernetes):**

```bash
./scripts/deploy-alibaba-cloud.sh
```

## Automated Revenue Generation

The SovereigntyOS AI platform implements automated revenue generation through:

### 1. API Monetization

*   **Alibaba Cloud API Gateway** exposes `sovereigntyos_ai` functions as managed APIs
*   APIs are configured with authentication, rate limiting, and usage tracking
*   Monetization is enabled directly through the API Gateway

### 2. Usage Tracking

*   In-function logging tracks relevant usage metrics (invocations, data processed, features used)
*   Logs are stored in Alibaba Cloud Log Service or a dedicated database
*   Usage data is processed periodically to calculate billable events

### 3. Billing and Payment Integration

*   Integration with payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal) for customer billing
*   Automated invoice generation based on tracked usage
*   Alibaba Cloud Billing API (`BssOpenApi`) for cost reconciliation

### 4. Subscription Management

*   Subscription tiers defined by GPT-5 orchestrator
*   Access control implemented in `sovereigntyos_ai` functions
*   Automated lifecycle management (activation, renewal, cancellation) by Kimi K2

## Starting the Agent TARS Task

To initiate the multi-agent orchestration:

```bash
agent-tars --config ./agent-tars.config.ts --start-command "@Manus manus-ai start task [SovereigntyOS] Production Build & Hardening for CronJob Image, Alibaba Cloud Deployment, and Automated Revenue Generation"
```

## Additional Documentation

*   **`docs/alibaba_cloud_deployment_plan.md`**: Detailed deployment plan for Alibaba Cloud
*   **`docs/implementation_guide.md`**: Comprehensive implementation guide
*   **`docs/revenue_generation_summary.md`**: Revenue generation strategies and integration

## Support and Troubleshooting

For issues or questions:
1.  Check the GitHub Actions logs for deployment errors
2.  Review Alibaba Cloud SAE/ACK logs for runtime issues
3.  Consult the detailed documentation in the `docs/` directory
4.  Open an issue in the GitHub repository
